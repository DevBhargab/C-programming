<p style="font-size: 25px;">
        This is a paragraph with increased font size.
    The day  2023/1/4 the first day at my high school Kalyangarh Vidya Mandir.
        I went to my class and found no one whom I know or seem to remember.I go straight at the last bench and took a seat.
        As soon as the first class of science started the teacher introdced me to the whole class.
        Everyone in the class came one year ago my arrival so,they are well known to each other.
        I got the section c and roll no 48 as the last studennt.But I had no problem with it.
        Classes went by and I took my studies seriously. In the tiffin time I already got a friend named shreyan.
        He was not new but he decided to have a friendship with me and I wil
        definately accept it because of the fact I dont have any friends.In
        the 5th period i changed my seat beside him to know about him and 
        the education system of the school. I came to know that his roll was 6 and 
        he was a good student. At the time of the end of 7th period the school ends 
        got  an best friend for the whole summative .
