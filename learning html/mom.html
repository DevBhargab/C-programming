        Mom  is the sunlight of everyones light . They are very precious for everyone . The first language
        everyone learn is their mother tounge. Everyones mother teach them manners,feed them,bath them,
        teach the basics of study. Sometimes strict, sometimes caring, sometimes pampering, sometimes they
        even beats you up . They are the guiding line of the life . But my mother was something diffrent, 
        she was cool and chill she never become angry and never beats me . Most of the time I get beaten 
        by my grandmother but my mother was always wants to become  my friend. She always fulfill all of
        my demands. My mother was a working women she loves to work she has a buissness . I always call 
        him with a special name mommy although his name was Anwesha Maliick.
