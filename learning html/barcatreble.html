<p>Messi was born in Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina, to Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and Celia Cuccittini, a part-time cleaner. From a young age, he showed immense talent in football. Diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency at age 10, his future in football was uncertain. Despite the challenges, Messi's skills caught the attention of FC Barcelona scouts. At age 13, he moved to Spain with his family after Barcelona agreed to cover his medical expenses and enroll him in their famed La Masia academy.</p>
